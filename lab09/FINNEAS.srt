00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:47,080
I like to push my luck so take my hand let's take a drive

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,309

00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:54,899
Hoping I might see you sooner

14
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,340

19
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,100
You can bet I'll know every line 

20
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,420
I'm a boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid 

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,310
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,979
I know better than to call you mine

23
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,729
I love it when you talk that nerdy shit

24
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:40,690
We're in our twenties talking thirties shit

25
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,880
We're making money but we're saving it 

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,430
'Cause talking shit is cheap and we talk a lot of it

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,430
You won't stay with me, I know

28
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,770
But you can have your way with me until you go

29
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,629
And before your kisses turn into bruises, I'm a warning

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,400 
Let's fall in love for the night

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,860
And forget in the morning

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,760 
Play me a song that you like
 
33
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,340
You can bet I'll know every line

34
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:33,310
'Cause I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid

35
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:42,040
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise

36
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,660
I know better

37
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,220
I know better

38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:03:00,490
I know better than to ever call you mine
